Title: Introducing django CMS technical bulletins
Author: Daniele Procida
Date: 4th September 2015

A Technical Bulletin is an official statement issued by the django CMS Technical Board.

A technical bulletin can describe:

* a new feature that will be developed for the CMS
* a policy or standard that governs the CMS's development
* a design decision

Anyone can write or propose a technical bulletin, and anyone can discuss a proposed technical
bulletin, but the Technical Board's approval is required for its acceptance.

The purpose of technical bulletins is to improve communication within the django CMS community,
particularly about the direction and future development of the project.

Proposals for technical bulletins should be published and discussed on the django CMS developers
email list.

Once a proposal can be written up in a form that makes clear its intentions, it may
be submitted as a pull request to this repository.

Once accepted by the Technical Board, the pull request will be merged and the proposal will become
a bulletin.
